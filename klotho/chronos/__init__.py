`Chronos` is a specialized module for working with time and rhythm in music.

The word "chronos" originates from Ancient Greek and is deeply rooted in both language 
and mythology. In Greek, "χρόνος" (chronos) means "time".

In Greek mythology, Chronos (not to be confused with Cronus, the Titan) is personified as 
the god of time. His representation often symbolizes the endless passage of time and the 
cycles of creation and destruction within the universe.
